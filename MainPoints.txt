Main points to talk about in video and write up

-Challenges
   -How to test if divisible by N
   -How to generate numbers to check for divisible by N
   -How to tell if number is a palindrome and divisible by N
-Problem insights
   -Figured out how to create modulous DFA
   -Figured out that if M/2 is divisible by N it can be reversed and concatinated to the left side to create a 
    palindrome that is also divisible by N
      -Example 012 is divisible by 4 so the reverse 210 concatinated with 012 equals 210012 which is a 
       palindrome divisible by 4
      -This significantly cut down on time taken
   -We noticed if we bagan to generate numbers with a rightmost digit greater than a number already generated
    we could stop looking for numbers to test because when reversed as mentioned above the complete palindrome
    will have a greater leftmost digit making the value larger than previously generated numbers.
       -This only works because we are looking for the smallest palindrome
